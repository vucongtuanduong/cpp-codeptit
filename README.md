# CPP_PTIT



## Getting started

This repository contains almost everything I practice and take exam in my c++ course at PTIT

Sorry because I can't post the problems here because I want only PTIT students can take advantages of my accepted code and I also don't want to violate code of conduct(obviously)

But if you are not PTIT students, this repository may helpful to you though. You can predict and guess the problems by comprehend my code!

Hope all of you can be helped by this repository!


## More information

## My thought
I have put a lot of effort in this course this term because this course is important and also because of the result of previous course from last term which fell short of my expectation.\
And finally, hard work pays off! I really happy with the final result. Prepare both mental and physical health for next term with much more hard and important course - DSA. \
To be honest, when I was typing this, I haven't finised all final tern test yet and also haven't found out the method and strategy to efficiently master this course yet, but I know I have to go thorough trial and errors to find the best way to learn\
Looking forward to the next term!\
\
Next stop: DSA !!
