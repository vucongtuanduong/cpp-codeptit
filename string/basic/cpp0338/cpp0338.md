# 1
This code is implementing a sliding window algorithm to find the number of substrings of a given string that contain exactly 'n' unique characters.
##
Algorithm:
##
The code first reads the number of test cases.
##
For each test case, it reads a string 's' and an integer 'n'.
##
Then it initializes an answer variable 'ans' to 0 which will store the final result.
##
It then iterates through each character of the string. For each character, it initializes a map 'mp' which will store the unique characters in the current substring and their counts.
##
It then starts another loop from the current character to the end of the string. In this loop, it adds the current character to the map and increments the end of the substring 'j'.
##
If the size of the map (which is the number of unique characters in the current substring) is equal to 'n', it increments 'ans' by 1.
##
The inner loop continues until the size of the map is greater than 'n' or it has reached the end of the string.
##
This process is repeated for each character of the string.
##
Finally, it outputs the value of 'ans' which is the number of substrings with exactly 'n' unique characters.
Time Complexity:
##
The outer loop runs 's.size()' times and for each character, the inner loop can run up to 's.size()' times. Therefore, the time complexity of this code is O((s.size())^2). In the worst case, this can be quite inefficient if the size of the string is large.
##
Space Complexity:
##
The space complexity of this code is O(s.size()) due to the use of the map 'mp' which can store up to 's.size()' elements in the worst case.
