1.
see testCase function for further information:
first we will create string p and q that meets the demand and convert from string to long long and calculate gcd
=>result:WA (although test still true)
2.
see `testCase2` function for further information
now we know that the result is the a repeat n times, where n is the gcd(x, y)
=>result: AC
