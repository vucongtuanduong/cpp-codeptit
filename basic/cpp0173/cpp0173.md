1.
we calculate temp is the lcm of (x, y, z)
left = pow(10, n -1), right = pow(10, n);
and l = sqrt(left); r = sqrt(right)
then we check if l > r or l == 0 or r ==0 to print -1(not found)
else we check if l*l == left : we will print l * temp
else we will print (l + 1) * temp
=>result: WA
2.
we check if temp > right to print -1
else we check if left % temp == 0 to print left immediately(left is the number we have to find)
else we print (l + 1) * temp
=>result: AC
