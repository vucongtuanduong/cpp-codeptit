This code is implementing a solution to a problem where you are given an array and you need to make the elements of the array from both ends (left and right) equal by only using the operation of merging two adjacent elements into one and replacing the two elements with their sum. The problem is to find the minimum number of such operations.
##
The algorithm works as follows:
##
Read the number of test cases.
For each test case, read the size of the array and the elements of the array.
##
Initialize two pointers, one at the start (left) and the other at the end (right) of the array and a counter (count) to keep track of the number of operations.
##
While the left pointer is less than or equal to the right pointer, do the following: 
###
a. If the elements at the left and right pointers are equal, move both pointers towards the center. 
###
b. If the element at the left pointer is less than the element at the right pointer, move the left pointer to the right and add the element at the new left pointer to the element at the previous left pointer. Increase the counter. 
###
c. If the element at the left pointer is greater than the element at the right pointer, move the right pointer to the left and add the element at the new right pointer to the element at the previous right pointer. Increase the counter.
##
Print the value of the counter.
##
Time Complexity: The time complexity of the algorithm is O(n) because in the worst case, we are traversing the entire array once.
##
Space Complexity: The space complexity of the algorithm is O(n) because we are using a vector to store the elements of the array which is part of the input.

Algorithm explanation: Two-pointer technique and greedy strategy
##
The algorithm works based on the principle of two-pointer technique and greedy strategy.
##
The two-pointer technique is used to traverse the array from both ends towards the center. The greedy strategy is used to perform the minimum number of operations to make the elements at the two pointers equal.
##
Here's why it works:
##
If the elements at both pointers are already equal, we simply move both pointers towards the center. This is because no operation is needed in this case as the elements are already equal.
##
If the element at the left pointer is less than the element at the right pointer, we merge the element at the left pointer with the next element on its right. This is based on the greedy strategy that it's optimal to merge smaller elements to make them equal to larger ones. We then move the left pointer to the right and increment the operation counter.
##
If the element at the left pointer is greater than the element at the right pointer, we merge the element at the right pointer with the next element on its left, move the right pointer to the left and increment the operation counter.
##
By repeating these steps, we ensure that the elements at both pointers are made equal with the minimum number of operations. When the pointers meet or cross each other, we have traversed the entire array and made the elements equal from both ends. The operation counter at this point gives the minimum number of operations required.
