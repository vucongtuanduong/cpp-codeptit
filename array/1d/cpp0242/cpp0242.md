# 1
The given code is solving the problem of finding the longest contiguous subarray in two given binary arrays (arrays of 0s and 1s) such that the sum of elements in that subarray is equal in both arrays. The problem is solved using the prefix sum technique and brute force method.
##
Algorithm:
##
Read the number of test cases.
###
For each test case, do the following: 
###
a. Read the size of the arrays. 
###
b. Read the elements of the first array and compute its prefix sum. 
###
c. Read the elements of the second array and compute its prefix sum. 
###
d. Initialize the answer as 0. This variable will store the length of the longest subarray with equal sum in both arrays. 
###
e. For each pair of indices (i, j) such that 1 <= j <= i <= n, if the sum of elements from j to i is the same in both arrays (which is the difference between the prefix sum at i and the prefix sum at j-1), update the answer as the maximum of the current answer and the length of the current subarray (i - j + 1).
##
Print the answer for each test case.
##
Complexity Analysis:
##
The time complexity of the algorithm is O(n^3) because for each pair of indices (i, j), we perform a constant amount of work, and there are O(n^2) such pairs, and we have to perform this for 'n' elements.
##
The space complexity is O(n) because we store the elements and their prefix sums in two arrays of size n.
##
Note: This code can be optimized to run in O(n) time by using a hash map to store the difference between the prefix sums of the two arrays at each index.

Algorithm for finding longest common subarray with equal sum
This code is solving a problem of finding the longest common subarray in two arrays (M and N) where the sum of elements in the subarray is the same for both arrays.
##
The algorithm works as follows:
##
The code starts by reading the number of test cases.
##
For each test case, it reads the size of the arrays (n) and then the elements of both arrays.
##
It then initializes a variable "max" to keep track of the length of the longest common subarray found so far.
##
It uses a nested loop to compare all possible subarrays of M and N. For each subarray, it calculates the sum of elements (x for M and y for N) and checks if they are equal. If they are and the length of the subarray is greater than the current "max", it updates "max".
##
Finally, it prints the length of the longest common subarray found.
##
The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n^3) because it uses a nested loop to compare all possible subarrays, which in the worst case can be O(n^2), and for each subarray, it calculates the sum of elements, which can be O(n) in the worst case. Therefore, the overall time complexity is O(n^3).
##
The space complexity is O(n) because it needs to store the elements of the two arrays.
