To solve this problem, you can follow these steps:
## 
Loop through each test case.

For each test case, get the values of n, L, R, and the array A[].
Extract the subarray from the given array A[] using the given range [L, R].
##
Check if the extracted subarray forms a mountain array or not.
###
A mountain array is an array that first increases, reaches a peak, and then decreases. There can be multiple peaks (increasing and decreasing parts) in a mountain array.
To check this, you can keep two flags, one for increasing and one for decreasing. Start with the increasing flag as true and decreasing as false. Traverse the subarray, and if the next element is greater than the current one and you are in an increasing sequence, continue. If the next element is less than the current one, set the increasing flag as false and the decreasing flag as true. If you are in a decreasing sequence and the next element is greater than the current one, return "No" as it does not form a mountain array. If you reach the end of the array and you are in a decreasing sequence, return "Yes".
##
Print the result for each test case.
##
Remember to handle the edge cases, such as when the subarray has only one or two elements.

# 2
 
## first attempt
missing one edge case: full increasing or decreasing sub array is not a mountain array

## second attempt
use the change variable to keep track but still WA

## third attempt
use second way that recommends by chatgpt but still WA

## fourth attempt (redo)
we use `decrease` bool variable to keep track if the subarray is decrease or not and initialize it first equal to false (that means the subarray first increasing) and set to true at the index where when we first meet the elements decrease. If `decrease` is true and we find out that the sub increase , that means this subarray is not a mountain array
