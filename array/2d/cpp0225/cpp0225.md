This code is a solution to a problem where we are given a square matrix (2D array) of size n x n and we need to perform operations to make the sum of each row and each column equal to the maximum sum of any row or column in the original matrix. The operation we can use is adding positive integers to any element of the matrix. The goal is to find the minimum total number of operations (i.e., the minimum total amount added) to achieve this.
##
Here's how the code works:
##
The TestCase() function handles each individual test case. It starts by reading the size n of the matrix and the elements of the matrix a.
##
It calculates the sum of each row and each column in the matrix, and keeps track of the maximum sum maxx found so far.
##
If the maximum sum is found in a row, it sets flag = 0. If the maximum sum is found in a column, it sets flag = 1.
##
After all rows and columns have been processed, it calculates the total number of operations required to make all row sums or all column sums equal to maxx, depending on the value of flag.
##
It does this by iterating over all column sums (if flag = 0) or all row sums (if flag = 1), and for each sum, it adds maxx - sum to res. This represents the amount that needs to be added to each row or column to make its sum equal to maxx.
##
Finally, it prints the total number of operations res.
##
The main() function reads the number of test cases T and then calls TestCase() for each test case.
##
This solution works because the minimum number of operations required to make all row sums or all column sums equal to the maximum sum is simply the difference between the maximum sum and each individual sum. This is because we can always add the required amount to one element of each row or column, which is the most efficient way to increase the sum.
