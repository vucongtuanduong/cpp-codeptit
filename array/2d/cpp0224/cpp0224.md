# BFS Algorithm for Counting Regions in a Matrix
##
The code implements the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm to solve the problem of counting the number of regions in a matrix where each region is a group of connected cells with the value of 1. A cell is considered connected to another cell if they are adjacent to each other either vertically, horizontally, or diagonally.
##
Detailed Algorithm:
##
The program starts by reading the number of test cases (T).
For each test case, it reads the dimensions of the matrix (n x m) and the elements of the matrix.
##
Then it iterates over each cell of the matrix. If the cell value is 1, it increments the result counter (res) and calls the BFS function on that cell.
##
The BFS function sets the value of the current cell to 0 and then recursively calls BFS on all its adjacent cells that have a value of 1. This will effectively set all the cells in the current region to 0.
##
The result counter (res) now holds the number of regions in the matrix, so it is printed out.
##
Complexity Analysis:
###
The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n*m) as it potentially visits every cell in the matrix once.
###
The space complexity is O(n*m) as well, due to the space required to store the matrix and the recursion stack in the worst case scenario.

Breadth-First Search (BFS) Algorithm for Counting Distinct Regions
##
The algorithm used in this code is called Breadth-First Search (BFS). It's a popular algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. It starts at the tree root (or some arbitrary node of a graph, sometimes referred to as a 'search key') and explores the neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level.
##
In this specific code, BFS is used to count the number of distinct regions in a matrix. Each region is a group of adjacent cells with the value 1. Two cells are considered adjacent if they share an edge or a corner. The code uses BFS to explore all cells of a region starting from a given cell, and mark them as visited (by setting their value to 0) to avoid visiting the same cell again.
##
Here's a step-by-step explanation of the BFS implementation in this code:
##
The BFS function is called with a starting cell (r, c) as an argument.
###
For each of the eight possible directions (up, down, left, right, up-left, up-right, down-left, down-right), it calculates the coordinates of the adjacent cell.
###
If the adjacent cell is within the matrix bounds and its value is 1, it sets the value of the cell to 0 (marking it as visited) and calls BFS for this cell.
###
This process continues until all cells of the current region have been visited.
###
The main function of the code creates a matrix from the input, and then iterates over all cells of the matrix. When it finds a cell with value 1, it increments the region counter and calls the BFS function to explore the region and mark its cells as visited.
###
The time complexity of this algorithm is O(nm), where n and m are the dimensions of the matrix, because in the worst case scenario it needs to visit all cells of the matrix. The space complexity is also O(nm) because in the worst case scenario the call stack can grow up to n*m deep due to recursive calls to the BFS function.

Initialization of Arrays for Grid-based Algorithms
The two arrays X and Y are initialized to represent the eight possible directions from any cell in a 2D grid (up, down, left, right, and the four diagonals). This is a common technique used in grid-based algorithms to simplify the code and make it more readable.
##
Here's how it works:
##
Each index i from 0 to 7 in the arrays X and Y represents a direction.
##
X[i] and Y[i] represent the change in the row and column indices respectively when moving in direction i.
##
For example, X[0] and Y[0] are both -1. This means that if you're at a cell (r, c) in the grid, moving in direction 0 would take you to the cell (r - 1, c - 1), which is the top-left diagonal cell.
##
Similarly, X[3] is 0 and Y[3] is 1. This means that moving in direction 3 would take you to the cell (r, c + 1), which is the cell to the right.
##
The arrays X and Y are filled with these values based on the knowledge of how a 2D grid works.
