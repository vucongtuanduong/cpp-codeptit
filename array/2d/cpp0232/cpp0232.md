This code is solving the problem of finding the maximum area of a rectangle in a binary sub-matrix. The algorithm works as follows:
##
It first reads the number of test cases t from the input.
##
For each test case, it reads the dimensions m and n of the matrix, and then the elements of the matrix M.
##
It creates a new matrix N with the same dimensions as M. For each column, it starts from the top and goes down, copying the value from M to N if it's the first row or if the value in M is 0. If the value in M is not 0 and it's not the first row, it adds the value from the cell above in N to the value in M and stores the result in N. This results in N containing, for each cell, the number of consecutive 1's in M above and including that cell.
##
It then sorts each row of N in ascending order.
##
It calculates the maximum area of a rectangle that can be formed in the binary sub-matrix. It does this by iterating over each cell in N from right to left and from top to bottom, multiplying the value in the cell by the number of cells to its right (including itself) and updating the maximum area if the result is larger. The reason this works is that the value in the cell represents the height of the rectangle, and the number of cells to its right represents the width.
##
Finally, it prints the maximum area calculated. The process is then repeated for the next test case.
##
This algorithm is a dynamic programming solution to the problem, and it has a time complexity of O(mnlog(n)) due to the sorting step.
# 2
This code is trying to find the maximum area of a rectangle in a binary matrix. Here is the algorithm of the code:
##
The program starts by reading an integer t which represents the number of test cases.
##
For each test case, the program reads two integers m and n which represent the dimensions of the binary matrix.
##
The binary matrix M is read from the standard input.
##
The program then initializes an auxiliary matrix N with the same dimensions as M. The purpose of this matrix is to store the 'height' of the rectangle that can be formed ending at each cell in the binary matrix.
##
For each column j, it starts by copying the first row of M to N. Then for each subsequent row i, if M[i][j] is 0, it sets N[i][j] to 0. Otherwise, it sets N[i][j] to N[i - 1][j] + 1. This is because if M[i][j] is 1, a rectangle of height N[i - 1][j] + 1 can be formed ending at M[i][j].
##
After filling up N, the program sorts each row of N.
##
The program then iterates over the sorted N to find the maximum area of the rectangle that can be formed. For each cell N[i][j], the area of the rectangle that can be formed is N[i][j] * (n - j). The program keeps track of the maximum area found so far.
##
Finally, the program prints out the maximum area found.
##
This algorithm works because the maximum area of a rectangle in a binary matrix is the maximum among the areas of the rectangles that can be formed ending at each cell in the matrix. By sorting each row of N, the program ensures that it considers larger rectangles first.

## : complexity
The time complexity of the algorithm is O(mnlog(n)) where m is the number of rows and n is the number of columns in the matrix.

Here is the breakdown of the complexity:
##
Reading the input matrix: O(m*n)
###
Calculating the height matrix: O(m*n)
###
Sorting each row of the height matrix: m * O(nlog(n)) = O(mn*log(n))
###
Finding the maximum area: O(m*n)
So, the overall complexity is dominated by the sorting step, hence the complexity is O(mnlog(n)).
###
The space complexity of the algorithm is O(m*n) as we are storing the entire matrix.
