The rotation is done layer by layer, from the outermost layer to the innermost one. Each layer can be visualized as a ring in the matrix.
## 
For example, consider a 3x3 matrix:

1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9
Here, there are two layers: the outer layer consisting of the numbers 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 8, 7, 4, and the inner layer consisting of the number 5.
##
In the code, the outer loop for (int i = n - 1; i >= n / 2; i--) iterates over the layers. The index i starts from n-1 (the outermost layer) and decreases until it reaches n/2 (the innermost layer).
##
For each layer, the inner loop for (int j = n - i; j <= i; j++) iterates over the elements in the layer. The index j starts from n-i and increases until it reaches i.
##
Then, for each element in the current layer, the code performs four assignments that effectively move the elements one step clockwise:
###
b[n - i - 1][j] = a[n - i - 1][j - 1]; moves the elements on the top row of the current layer one step to the right.
###
b[i][j - 1] = a[i][j]; moves the elements on the bottom row of the current layer one step to the left.
###
b[j][i] = a[j - 1][i]; moves the elements on the right column of the current layer one step down.
###
b[j - 1][n - i - 1] = a[j][n - i - 1]; moves the elements on the left column of the current layer one step up.
##
As a result, all elements in the current layer are moved one step in the clockwise direction. This process is repeated for all layers, resulting in a clockwise rotation of the entire matrix.

explain by using one example for me

Clockwise rotation of a 3x3 matrix explained.

Sure, let's take a 3x3 matrix as an example:
##
Original matrix a:
##
1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9
First, we'll start with the outer layer (i = 2). The elements in this layer are 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 8, 7, 4. After rotating this layer, we get:
##
4 1 2
7 5 3
8 9 6
Next, we move on to the inner layer (i = 1). The only element in this layer is 5, which doesn't move when rotated. So, the final result is:
##
4 1 2
7 5 3
8 9 6
This is the clockwise rotation of the original matrix.
##
The rotation is done by swapping elements. For example, in the outer layer, 1 is moved to the position of 2, 2 is moved to the position of 3, 3 is moved to the position of 6, 6 is moved to the position of 9, 9 is moved to the position of 8, 8 is moved to the position of 7, 7 is moved to the position of 4, and 4 is moved to the position of 1.
